## Train/Test Split

### Code Section (Lines 73-80):
```r
# --- Train/Test Split (80/20) ---
set.seed(123)
# Ensure response is a factor (should already be from earlier step)
churn_data$Churn <- as.factor(churn_data$Churn)

trainIndex <- createDataPartition(churn_data$Churn, p = 0.8, list = FALSE, times = 1)
train_data <- churn_data[trainIndex, ]
test_data  <- churn_data[-trainIndex, ]
```

### Line-by-Line Explanation:

#### **Line 74: `set.seed(123)`**
- **What it does:** Sets a random number generator seed
- **Why it matters:** Ensures reproducibility - you'll get the same train/test split every time you run the code
- **Without it:** Random splits would differ each run, making results impossible to compare

#### **Line 76: `churn_data$Churn <- as.factor(churn_data$Churn)`**
- **What it does:** Converts the Churn column to a categorical (factor) variable
- **Why it matters:** 
  - Classification models in R need the target variable to be a factor
  - Tells R this is a classification problem, not regression
  - Ensures "Yes"/"No" are treated as categories, not text

#### **Line 78: `trainIndex <- createDataPartition(...)`**
- **What it does:** Creates indices for splitting data into 80% training, 20% testing
- **Parameters:**
  - `churn_data$Churn`: Stratify by the target variable
  - `p = 0.8`: Use 80% for training
  - `list = FALSE`: Return as vector, not list
  - `times = 1`: Create one split
- **Why stratification matters:** Ensures both train and test have similar churn rates (~26.5%)

#### **Line 79: `train_data <- churn_data[trainIndex, ]`**
- **What it does:** Creates training dataset using the selected indices
- **Result:** ~5,634 customers (80% of 7,043)

#### **Line 80: `test_data <- churn_data[-trainIndex, ]`**
- **What it does:** Creates test dataset using remaining indices (the `-` means "exclude")
- **Result:** ~1,409 customers (20% of 7,043)

### **Why Split Data?**
```
Original Data (7,043 customers)
    ↓
    ├─→ Train (80%) = 5,634 customers
    │   └─→ Model LEARNS patterns here
    │
    └─→ Test (20%) = 1,409 customers
        └─→ Model is EVALUATED here (never seen before)
```

**Key Concept:** The model must perform well on data it has NEVER seen to prove it generalizes.

## Logistic Regression

### Code Section (Lines 83-94):
```r
# --- Train Models ---
# Logistic Regression
log_model <- glm(Churn ~ ., data = train_data, family = binomial)

# --- Evaluate Models ---
# Logistic Regression Predictions
log_predictions <- predict(log_model, test_data, type = "response")
log_pred_class <- factor(ifelse(log_predictions > 0.5, "Yes", "No"),
                         levels = levels(test_data$Churn))
cm_log <- confusionMatrix(log_pred_class, test_data$Churn, positive = "Yes")
print(cm_log)
```

### Line-by-Line Explanation:

#### **Line 84: `log_model <- glm(Churn ~ ., data = train_data, family = binomial)`**
- **What it does:** Trains a logistic regression model
- **Components:**
  - `Churn ~ .`: Predict Churn using ALL other variables (the `.` means "all columns except target")
  - `data = train_data`: Use training data only
  - `family = binomial`: Tells R this is binary classification (Yes/No)
- **What the model learns:** How each feature (contract type, monthly charges, etc.) affects churn probability

#### **Line 90: `log_predictions <- predict(log_model, test_data, type = "response")`**
- **What it does:** Makes predictions on test data
- **`type = "response"`:** Returns probabilities (0 to 1) instead of log-odds
- **Output example:** `[0.23, 0.87, 0.41, ...]` 
  - 0.23 = 23% chance of churn
  - 0.87 = 87% chance of churn

#### **Lines 91-92: Convert probabilities to classes**
```r
log_pred_class <- factor(ifelse(log_predictions > 0.5, "Yes", "No"),
                         levels = levels(test_data$Churn))
```
- **What it does:** Converts probabilities to "Yes"/"No" predictions
- **Decision rule:** If probability > 0.5 → predict "Yes", else "No"
- **Why factor with levels:** Ensures predictions match test data format

#### **Line 93: `cm_log <- confusionMatrix(log_pred_class, test_data$Churn, positive = "Yes")`**
- **What it does:** Creates confusion matrix comparing predictions vs actual values
- **`positive = "Yes"`:** Treats "Yes" (churn) as the positive class
- **Why it matters:** This determines which class sensitivity/specificity refer to

---

## Random Forest

### Code Section (Lines 86, 96-100):
```r
# Random Forest
rf_model <- randomForest(Churn ~ ., data = train_data)

# Random Forest Predictions
rf_predictions <- predict(rf_model, test_data)
rf_predictions <- factor(rf_predictions, levels = levels(test_data$Churn))
cm_rf <- confusionMatrix(rf_predictions, test_data$Churn, positive = "Yes")
print(cm_rf)
```

### Line-by-Line Explanation:

#### **Line 86: `rf_model <- randomForest(Churn ~ ., data = train_data)`**
- **What it does:** Trains a Random Forest model with 500 trees (default)
- **How it works:**
  1. Creates 500 decision trees
  2. Each tree uses random subset of features
  3. Each tree uses random subset of training samples (bootstrap)
  4. Final prediction = majority vote of all 500 trees
- **Advantage over logistic regression:** Can capture non-linear patterns and interactions

#### **Line 97: `rf_predictions <- predict(rf_model, test_data)`**
- **What it does:** Predicts directly as classes ("Yes"/"No")
- **Note:** Unlike logistic regression, this doesn't return probabilities by default
- **Behind the scenes:** 500 trees vote, majority wins

#### **Line 98: `rf_predictions <- factor(rf_predictions, levels = levels(test_data$Churn))`**
- **What it does:** Ensures prediction factor levels match test data
- **Why needed:** Prevents confusion matrix errors

---

## Linear Probability Model

### Code Section (Lines 102-120):
```r
# --- Linear Probability Model (LPM) ---
# Create numeric target for linear regression (0/1) without altering original columns
train_lpm <- train_data %>% mutate(Churn_num = if_else(Churn == "Yes", 1, 0))
test_lpm  <- test_data  %>% mutate(Churn_num = if_else(Churn == "Yes", 1, 0))

# Fit linear regression using all predictors except the factor target
lpm_model <- lm(Churn_num ~ . - Churn, data = train_lpm)
print(summary(lpm_model))

# Predict numeric values (may fall outside [0,1]) and evaluate
lpm_pred_num <- predict(lpm_model, newdata = test_lpm)
rmse <- sqrt(mean((lpm_pred_num - test_lpm$Churn_num)^2))
prop_out_of_bounds <- mean(lpm_pred_num < 0 | lpm_pred_num > 1)
print(list(LPM_RMSE = rmse, Proportion_Out_Of_Bounds = prop_out_of_bounds))

# Classify at 0.5 threshold and compute confusion matrix
lpm_pred_class <- factor(ifelse(lpm_pred_num > 0.5, "Yes", "No"), levels = levels(test_data$Churn))
cm_lpm <- confusionMatrix(lpm_pred_class, test_data$Churn, positive = "Yes")
print(cm_lpm)
```

### Line-by-Line Explanation:

#### **Lines 104-105: Create numeric target**
```r
train_lpm <- train_data %>% mutate(Churn_num = if_else(Churn == "Yes", 1, 0))
test_lpm  <- test_data  %>% mutate(Churn_num = if_else(Churn == "Yes", 1, 0))
```
- **What it does:** Creates a new column `Churn_num` where Yes=1, No=0
- **Why needed:** Linear regression needs numeric targets, not factors
- **Keeps original:** Retains the factor column for later comparison

#### **Line 108: `lpm_model <- lm(Churn_num ~ . - Churn, data = train_lpm)`**
- **What it does:** Fits ordinary linear regression
- **Formula:** `~ . - Churn` means "use all columns except the original Churn factor"
- **What it models:** Treats probability as a linear function of features
- **Key limitation:** Can predict values < 0 or > 1 (impossible probabilities!)

#### **Line 112: `lpm_pred_num <- predict(lpm_model, newdata = test_lpm)`**
- **What it does:** Predicts numeric churn probabilities
- **Output:** Continuous values (e.g., 0.73, -0.05, 1.12)
- **Problem:** Some may be negative or > 1

#### **Line 113: `rmse <- sqrt(mean((lpm_pred_num - test_lpm$Churn_num)^2))`**
- **What it does:** Calculates Root Mean Squared Error
- **Formula:** √(average of squared differences)
- **Lower = better:** Measures how close predictions are to actual 0/1 values

#### **Line 114: `prop_out_of_bounds <- mean(lpm_pred_num < 0 | lpm_pred_num > 1)`**
- **What it does:** Calculates proportion of impossible predictions
- **Example:** If 15% of predictions are < 0 or > 1, this shows the LPM problem

#### **Lines 118-120: Convert to classes and evaluate**
- Same as logistic regression, converts numeric predictions to "Yes"/"No" at 0.5 threshold
- Creates confusion matrix for comparison

## Analyzing Outputs

### 1. Confusion Matrix Output

When you run the code, you see:
```
Confusion Matrix and Statistics

          Reference
Prediction  No Yes
       No  930 167
       Yes 104 206
```

### **How to Read This:**

#### **The Grid:**
```
                    ACTUAL REALITY
                    No (Stayed) | Yes (Churned)
         ─────────┼─────────────┼──────────────
MODEL     No      │     930     │     167
SAYS      (Stay)  │  ✅ Correct │  ❌ MISSED
         ─────────┼─────────────┼──────────────
          Yes     │     104     │     206
          (Churn) │  ❌ False   │  ✅ Correct
                  │    Alarm    │
```

#### **Each Cell Means:**

## Key Insights & Recommendations

### **Main Problem: Low Sensitivity (55%)**

Your model is missing **45% of churners**. This is critical in churn prediction.

### **Why This Happens:**
1. **Class imbalance:** Only 26.5% churn, so model learns to predict "No" more often
2. **Conservative threshold:** Using 0.5 cutoff makes model cautious
3. **Model prioritizes accuracy over catching churners**

### **Solutions:**

#### **Option 1: Lower the threshold (Easy)**
```r
# Instead of 0.5, try 0.3 or 0.4
log_pred_class <- factor(ifelse(log_predictions > 0.3, "Yes", "No"),
                         levels = levels(test_data$Churn))
```
**Effect:** Catch more churners, but more false alarms

#### **Option 2: Class weights (Better)**
```r
# Tell Random Forest that missing a churner costs 3x more
rf_model <- randomForest(Churn ~ ., data = train_data, 
                         classwt = c(No = 1, Yes = 3))
```

#### **Option 3: Use different metric for success**
Focus on **F1-Score** (balance of precision and recall) instead of accuracy

## What Each Output Tells You

### **When you see High Accuracy (80%+) but Low Sensitivity (55%):**
- ✅ Model works overall
- ❌ **But misses many churners**
- 🎯 Action: Adjust threshold or use class weights

### **When Specificity (90%) >> Sensitivity (55%):**
- Model is **conservative** - only predicts churn when very confident
- Good: Few false alarms
- Bad: Misses many real churners
- 🎯 Action: Make model more aggressive

### **When Kappa is Moderate (0.48):**
- Model is better than guessing
- But there's room for improvement
- 🎯 Action: Try feature engineering or different algorithms

### **When False Negatives (167) > False Positives (104):**
- Model errs on the side of "won't churn"
- Business cost: Lost customers without intervention
- 🎯 Action: Rebalance model priorities

## Quick Reference: Metric Formulas

```r
# From Confusion Matrix:
#           Reference
# Prediction No  Yes
#        No  TN  FN
#        Yes FP  TP

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / Total
Sensitivity (Recall) = TP / (TP + FN)
Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)
Precision (PPV) = TP / (TP + FP)
Negative Pred Value = TN / (TN + FN)
F1-Score = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```
