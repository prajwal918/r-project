It then creates new synthetic samples by interpolating between the selected sample and its k-nearest neighbors. Specifically, SMOTE generates new samples by randomly selecting one of the k-nearest neighbors and then computing the difference between that neighbor and the original sample. It then multiplies this difference by a random number between 0 and 1 and adds the result to the original sample to create the synthetic sample.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"over = SMOTE(sampling_strategy = 1)\n\nx = data.drop(\"Churn Label\", axis = 1).values\ny = data['Churn Label'].values","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-09T21:32:48.751625Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-09T21:32:48.752062Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-09T21:32:48.760113Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-09T21:32:48.752022Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-09T21:32:48.758756Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"x,y = over.fit_resample(x,y)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-09T21:32:50.922352Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-09T21:32:50.922768Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-09T21:32:51.052312Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-09T21:32:50.922733Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-09T21:32:51.050926Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"22\"></a>\n# Build a model","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, random_state =2, test_size = 0.2)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-09T21:32:54.781599Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-09T21:32:54.782069Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-09T21:32:54.791539Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-09T21:32:54.782029Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-09T21:32:54.79013Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def model(method, x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test):\n    # Train the model\n    method.fit(x_train, y_train)\n    \n    # Make predictions on test data and calculate confusion matrix\n    predictions = method.predict(x_test)\n    c_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)\n    \n    # Calculate label percentages and create label strings with counts and percentages\n    percentages = (c_matrix / np.sum(c_matrix, axis=1)[:, np.newaxis]).round(2) * 100\n    labels = [[f\"{c_matrix[i, j]} ({percentages[i, j]:.2f}%)\" for j in range(c_matrix.shape[1])] for i in range(c_matrix.shape[0])]\n    labels = np.asarray(labels)\n    \n    # Plot confusion matrix with labeled counts and percentages\n    sns.heatmap(c_matrix, annot=labels, fmt='', cmap='Blues')\n    \n    # Evaluate model performance and print results\n    print(\"ROC AUC: \", '{:.2%}'.format(roc_auc_score(y_test, predictions)))\n    print(\"Model accuracy: \", '{:.2%}'.format(accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)))\n    print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))\n\n    ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-09T21:32:56.905234Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-09T21:32:56.905707Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-09T21:32:56.917234Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-09T21:32:56.905667Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-09T21:32:56.915782Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will use Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"xgb = XGBClassifier(learning_rate= 0.01,max_depth = 3,n_estimators = 1000)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-09T21:33:00.32877Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-09T21:33:00.329582Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-09T21:33:00.335689Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-09T21:33:00.329525Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-09T21:33:00.334396Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model(xgb,x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-09T21:33:03.523514Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-09T21:33:03.524216Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-09T21:33:12.573938Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-09T21:33:03.524148Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-09T21:33:12.572675Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Sooo, done","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![ML](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/37f7aa_79b2fb7d1561478088d098ee2f4e1f85~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_640,h_640,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/37f7aa_79b2fb7d1561478088d098ee2f4e1f85~mv2.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"23\"></a>\n# Conclusion","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In general, for churn prediction, minimizing false negatives (i.e., correctly identifying all customers who are likely to churn) may be more important than minimizing false positives (i.e., incorrectly identifying customers as likely to churn when they are not).
